# Population-Segmentation-using-AWS-SageMaker

# Summary
AWS workflow using SageMaker to work with US census data, to clean the data and to deploy the models


Two different models were worked with in this project

  A Principal component analysis (PCA) was trained and deployed to simplify population data
  
  PCA creates a few meaningful features which are used to train a k-means clustering model, the second model used in the project
  
  The model is then evaluated by looking at the model attributes
  
  Lastly the models are deployed to assign any of the data points to a certain cluster and observe what kind of features are commonly       shared
